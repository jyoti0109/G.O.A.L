            <p>
                Organ donation is the process of surgically<i><strong><u> removing an organ or tissue from one person (the donor) and transplanting it into another person (the recipient)</u></strong></i> who is in need of that organ due to illness, injury, or failure of the corresponding organ. Organs that can be donated include the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, and intestines, while tissues that can be donated include corneas, skin, bone, bone marrow, and heart valves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Organ donation can save lives, improve health, and enhance the quality of life for recipients. It offers hope to individuals suffering from organ failure or irreversible organ damage. Donation can occur from deceased donors (after brain or cardiac death) or living donors (who typically donate a kidney or part of their liver).
